// individual securities
type SecurityTransaction struct {
	// Identifier for the security (stock, plan security, warrant, or convertible) by which it
	// can be referenced by other transaction objects. Note that while this identifier is
	// created with an issuance object, it should be different than the issuance object's `id`
	// field which identifies the issuance transaction object itself. All future transactions on
	// the security (e.g. acceptance, transfer, cancel, etc.) must reference this `security_id`
	// to qualify which security the transaction applies to.
